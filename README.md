# Tasks Assigned by  Zuraverse

### TASK: Develop demo Smart Contract for the one or more NFTs mentioned in the brief (Tree, Garden etc.) and feel free to add more features. 

**The smart contract file is NFT.sol** 

### Tree NFT enables the following functionalities:

* Minting Tree NFTs: The contract allows the owner to mint new Tree NFTs by calling the mintTree function. It takes parameters such as the recipient address, token ID, sapling ID, geotag, updates hash, and timestamp. This functionality creates a new Tree NFT with the specified details.

* Retrieving Tree Details: The getTree function allows anyone to retrieve the details of a specific Tree NFT by providing its token ID. It returns information such as the sapling ID, geotag, updates hash, timestamp, milestone timestamps, and milestone descriptions.

* Adding Milestones: The contract includes an addMilestone function that allows the owner to add milestones to a specific Tree NFT. The owner can provide the token ID, milestone timestamp, and milestone description as parameters. This functionality enables tracking and documenting important events or milestones in the life of a tree represented by the NFT.
